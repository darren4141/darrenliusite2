            <h1>First Robotics Competition 2024</h1>
            <p>The 2024 FRC game involved scoring rings into different-sized goals. As the team's lead programmer, I managed a team of 6 to ensure all subsystems were complete.

            <h2>Vision Processing:</h2>
            <p>Our robot’s front facing camera was connected to a Raspberry Pi running a vision model called PhotonVision, which could return angles describing the robot’s orientation from certain targets. Using these angles, I developed a formula that triangulated the robot’s distance from these targets.</p>

            <h2>Auto Aiming:</h2>
            <p>The distance value found from vision processing was used to automatically adjust the arm’s angle based on a function derived from test data to score game pieces from any distance.</p>
