            <h1>Smart Trash Bin</h1>
            <p>A bin made to gamify recycling, students would throw their trash/recycling into their desired bin. A camera and sensors within the garbage can will determine whether they threw their waste into the right target. Then, a servo will deposit the piece of waste into the correct bucket. Correct or incorrect guesses were added to a student's total stored on a flask server

            <p>For this project, we only needed two motion sensors but only had access to one. To solve this, I coded an ultrasonic sensor to act as a boolean motion sensor</p>
