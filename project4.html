            <h1>Smart Trash Bin</h1>
            <p>A bin made to gamify recycling, students would throw their trash/recycling into their desired bin. A camera and sensors within the garbage can will determine whether they threw their waste into the right target. Then, a servo will deposit the piece of waste into the correct bucket. Correct or incorrect guesses were added to a student's total stored on a flask server
            </p>

            <h2>Code Structure:</h2>
            <p>This was a multi-faceted project that involved hardware running on an ESP32 microcontroller, a phone camera running openCV and communicating with the hardware through serial, and a flask server displaying a database of user scores. Combining all of these aspects was arguably the most challenging part of this project.</p>

            <h2>Sensors:</h2>
            <p>For this project, we only needed two motion sensors but only had access to one. To solve this, I coded an ultrasonic sensor to act as a boolean motion sensor that would return true when nothing was in front of it and false when it detected an object</p>
            <p>To do this:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Read a value, convert it from signaltime to distance</li>
                <li>Take the average of the past 50 readings to get the "default value"</li>
                <li>Wait for a reading that deviates from the average</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start a timeout, if the reading has deviated from the average for more than 10 clock cycles, return false</li>
                    <li>This is done to filter out noise</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
