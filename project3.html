            <p>The 2023 FRC game involved picking up cones and cubes, and scoring them into goals of varying heights

            <p>The arm was controlled with a combined feedforward/feedback control method. The feedback loop was a PID loop and used the position, integral, and derivative of the error term to get the arm to a desired setpoint determined by user input. The feedforward loop accounted for the affects of gravity on the arm. The feedforward voltage scaled with cosine of the angle of the arm and accounted for the percentage extension of the arm since it would change the centre of mass</p>

            <h2>Wiring diagram:</h2>
            <p>The grey "RoboRio" acted as the main processor for the robot where the CAN bus (green & yellow) started and terminated. All components were powered through the PDP (red & black). The radio was used to connect to the laptop & controllers.</p>
