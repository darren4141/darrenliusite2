            <h1>Custom Mini Drone</h1>
            <h2 class="subtitle">2025 | In Progress</h2>
            <p>For this project I attempted to make a mini drone fully from scratch, including the CAD, electrical
                layout, and controls. This project gave me valuable experience with integrating electrical, mechanical,
                and software systems.</p>

            <h2>Perf board prototype</h2>
            <p>I soldered a prototype flight controller board for initial testing. The board was ESP32 based and
                communicated with an MPU6050 accelerometer using I2C. The motors are driven with MOSFETs</p>

            <h2>Controls setup</h2>
            <p>I used the built in DLPF on the IMU to get clean data readings and sent them to an ESP32 webserver to
                visualize the pitch and roll in 3D</p>

            <p>This controls page featured a re-zeroing function that averages the past 10 IMU readings to zero, PWM
                motor control, and IMU data logging.</p>

            <h2>CAD Design:</h2>
            <img src="project6/cover.png" width="100%">
            <p>For the CAD design, I tried to make something easily 3D-printable and repairable, while also being
                lightweight with propeller guards for safety purposes.</p>

            <h2>Custom flight controller PCB</h2>

            <img src="project6/DroneBoardRender.png" width="45%">
            <p>After verifying that the perf board and schematic worked, I designed a more compact flight controller
                PCB. It's STM-32 based and uses a shared SPI bus to communicate with a BMI270 IMU and an NRF24L01 radio
                module. Additionally it features bidirectional DRV motor drivers and onboard status LED's</p>

            <p>Additionally I designed a simple driver board for the BMI270 IMU so I could easily test it and write
                firmware quicker.</p>

            <h2>Quadcopter V2:</h2>
            <p>After some unsuccessful flight tests, I realized I would have to make some modifications to be able to
                achieve flight.</p>

            <p>I started by designing a lower profile flight controller PCB which used the smaller ESP32-XIAO C6
                microcontroller.</p>

            <h2>Initial thrust:</h2>
            <p>The pcb allowed for a much smaller and more symmetrical footprint. Additionally, I switched to smaller
                propellers.</p>
